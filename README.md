# Lab 3.2 - Practicing Implementation with Frontend Mentor

- How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding process?
  <br>
  Figma was an excellent resource for reference, as it provided a clear understanding and visualization of how I want my websites to look. The options for creating a prototype are extensive, allowing any user to bring their prototype to its full potential. While I do enjoy the "drag-and-drop" method of creating a prototype, I find that the plug-ins Figma offered to turn what we've created into code are quite clunky, so I honestly just preferred to code everything by hand. However, I can acknowledge that the plug-ins like Anima will create a decent skeleton of your design. I just don't prefer it.
  
- What challenges did you encounter when aligning your code with the design specifications?
  <br>
  I think my biggest challenge during this lab was having the layout be responsive to how I wanted it to be. At first, I initially used the % to size the width of my divs, but I just didn't like how skinny it became when the screen shrunk. I was using media queries to have that remedied, but unfortunately, it just did not have the outcome I preferred. I opted to use pixels to size my divs instead, and funny enough, the outcome was what I wanted.

- How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improve as a developer?
  I haven't messed with the feedback much, but the community resources are extremely helpful to speed things up. The community resources provided things like templates to build on, which can help me as a developer who is more focused on actually coding the web application. I also really liked the fact that Figma implemented a comments section for other team members to leave their feedback on a design.
